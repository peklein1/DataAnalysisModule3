-- Subqueries, CTEs, Window Functions, Views
-- =========================================================
-- Notes:
-- - Unless a question says otherwise, use orders with status = 'paid'.
-- - Write ONE query per prompt.
-- - Keep results readable (use clear aliases, ORDER BY where it helps).

-- =========================================================
-- Q1) Correlated subquery: Above-average order totals (PAID only)
-- =========================================================
-- For each PAID order, compute order_total (= SUM(quantity * products.price)).
-- Return: order_id, customer_name, store_name, order_datetime, order_total.
-- Filter to orders where order_total is greater than the average PAID order_total
-- for THAT SAME store (correlated subquery).
-- Sort by store_name, then order_total DESC.

-- Then, for each store and date, return:

-- =========================================================
-- For each store, find the top-selling product by REVENUE (not units).
-- Revenue per product per store = SUM(quantity * products.price).
-- Return: store_name, product_name, category_name, product_revenue.
-- Use a CTE to compute product_revenue, then a window function (ROW_NUMBER)
-- partitioned by store to select the top 1.
-- Sort by store_name.

-- =========================================================
-- Q5) Subquery: Customers who have ordered from ALL stores (PAID only)
-- =========================================================
-- Return customers who have at least one PAID order in every store in the stores table.
-- Return: customer_id, customer_name.
-- Hint: Compare count(distinct store_id) per customer to (select count(*) from stores).

-- =========================================================
-- For each customer, list their PAID orders in chronological order and compute:
--   prev_order_datetime (LAG),
--   minutes_since_prev (difference in minutes between current and previous order).
-- Return: customer_name, order_id, order_datetime, prev_order_datetime, minutes_since_prev.

-- Q7) View: Create a reusable order line view for PAID orders
-- =========================================================
-- Create a view named v_paid_order_lines that returns one row per PAID order item:

--   customer_id, customer_name,
--   product_id, product_name, category_name,
--   quantity, unit_price (= products.price),
--   line_total (= quantity * products.price)

--   store_name, category_name, revenue
-- where revenue is SUM(line_total),
-- sorted by revenue DESC.

-- =========================================================
-- Q8) View + window: Store revenue share by payment method (PAID only)
-- =========================================================
-- Create a view named v_paid_store_payments with:
--   store_id, store_name, payment_method, revenue
-- where revenue is total PAID revenue for that store/payment_method.
--
-- Then query the view to return:
--   store_name, payment_method, revenue,
--   store_total_revenue (window SUM over store),
--   pct_of_store_revenue (= revenue / store_total_revenue)
-- Sort by store_name, revenue DESC.

-- =========================================================
-- Q9) CTE: Inventory risk report (low stock relative to sales)
-- =========================================================
-- Identify items where on_hand is low compared to recent demand:
-- Using a CTE, compute total_units_sold per store/product for PAID orders.
-- Then join inventory to that result and return rows where:
--   on_hand < total_units_sold
-- Return: store_name, product_name, on_hand, total_units_sold, units_gap (= total_units_sold - on_hand)
-- Sort by units_gap DESC.
