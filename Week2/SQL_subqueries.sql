-- SUBQUERIES & NESTED LOGIC PRACTICE
-- =========================================================

-- Q1) Scalar subquery (AVG benchmark):
--     List products priced above the overall average product price.
--     Return product_id, name, price.
SELECT product_id, name, price
FROM products
WHERE price > (
    SELECT AVG(price)
    FROM products
);

-- Q2) Scalar subquery (MAX within category):
--     Find the most expensive product(s) in the 'Beans' category.
--     (Return all ties if more than one product shares the max price.)
--     Return product_id, name, price.
SELECT product_id, name, price
FROM products
WHERE category_id = (
    SELECT category_id
    FROM categories
    WHERE category_name = 'Beans'
)
AND price = (
    SELECT MAX(price)
    FROM products
    WHERE category_id = (
        SELECT category_id
        FROM categories
        WHERE category_name = 'Beans'
    )
);

-- Q3) List subquery (IN with nested lookup):
--     List customers who have purchased at least one product in the 'Merch' category.
--     Return customer_id, first_name, last_name.
--     Hint: Use a subquery to find the category_id for 'Merch', then a subquery to find product_ids.
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id IN (
    SELECT o.customer_id
    FROM orders o
    JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
    WHERE oi.product_id IN (
        SELECT product_id
        FROM products
        WHERE category_id = (
            SELECT category_id
            FROM categories
            WHERE category_name = 'Merch'
        )
    )
);

-- Q4) List subquery (NOT IN / anti-join logic):
--     List products that have never been ordered (their product_id never appears in order_items).
--     Return product_id, name, price.
SELECT product_id, name, price
FROM products
WHERE product_id NOT IN (
    SELECT product_id
    FROM order_items
);

-- Q5) Table subquery (derived table + compare to overall average):
--     Build a derived table that computes total_units_sold per product
--     (SUM(order_items.quantity) grouped by product_id).
--     Then return only products whose total_units_sold is greater than the
--     average total_units_sold across all products.
--     Return product_id, product_name, total_units_sold.
